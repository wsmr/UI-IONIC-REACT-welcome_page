Mobile App UI Development Task — Ionic Angular Project

Hi,

I’ve attached a mobile app single page screenshot that I want you to replicate as the UI for a new Ionic Angular mobile application.
Please follow these instructions carefully:

***Project Requirements***

1. UI Only — No Deep Logic
- Implement only the UI layer as shown in the attached image.
- Do not implement any functional or backend logic at this stage.

2. Pixel-Perfect Design
- Match the layout and appearance exactly as shown in the image.
- Focus on fonts, spacing, colors, alignment, shadows, icons, and components — everything should look identical, pixel by pixel.

3. Component-Based Structure
- Build using standalone Angular components to promote: Reusability, Scalability, Clean code separation
- Use meaningful names and folders (e.g., /components/HeaderComponent, /components/CardItem, etc.)

4. Mobile Responsiveness
- The UI must work flawlessly across all mobile screen sizes.
- Use Ionic's grid system, ion-grid, ion-row, ion-col, and responsive utilities to ensure flexibility and adaptability.

5. Animations & Motions
- Add smooth, user-friendly animations where appropriate: Card fade-ins, Button presses, Tab changes, Icons, colors, background effects, ext.
- Use Ionic’s animation utilities or CSS transitions.

6. Use Ionic Components
- Prioritize using Ionic's built-in components (e.g., ion-card, ion-button, ion-icon, ion-header, etc.) for maximum flexibility and native look.

7. Media Files (Very Important)
- Do not download or attach any external media files (icons, images, etc.) into the project.
- Instead: 
- - Use placeholder containers or comments where media is used.
- - Comment the code clearly with:
- - - Expected file name
- - - Recommended file size & dimensions
- - - Suggested path where the media should be added
- - - Aspect ratio or alignment tips if relevant
- Also document all these details in the README.md under a Media Requirements section.

8. Project Environment
- Ionic Version: 7+
- Angular: Latest supported version with Ionic
- Node.js: v22.14.0
- Project Type: Ionic Angular standalone project
- Use SCSS for styling if applicable

9. README.md Requirements
Include a detailed README.md with the following:
- How to install & run the project (ionic serve)
- Component structure overview
- Media Requirements section:
- - List of all media (images, icons, etc.) used in the UI
- - Where each media file should be added (path)
- - Expected dimensions, file names, and aspect ratios

10. Final Deliverable
- Provide the full ZIP file of the Ionic Angular UI project without node modules and unnecessary files.
- Must be build-ready, with no missing files or errors.
- All assets not included should be properly commented and documented.

Summary
- UI-only implementation based on the image.
- Focus on clean, scalable component-based code.
- Do not download or attach media — just comment and document.
- Match the layout and appearance exactly, with responsive design and animations.
- Include a complete README.md with project and media details.

Let me know if you have any questions before starting.
Thanks!
